Multiple threads modify shared data: primaryValues and secondaryValues lists

Primary Values:
locked by primaryLock before modifying the list of primary values

Secondary Values:
locked by secondaryLock before updating the list of secondary values

Consistency Check:
uses both primaryLock and secondaryLock so we make sure that during the consistency check, the values are not modified while being read
